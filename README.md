- 👋 Hi, I’m Gokce SAN MUTLU. I work on programming. I am continuing my associate degree in this field. I am also taking a long-term course from an expert in the programming. I also improve myself through other resources.
- 👀 I’m currently focusing on HTML, CSS, Javascript and other technologies used in frontend development like Boostrap, Redux, TypeScript etc.
- 🌱 I started my career as a lawyer. Working with different people and in different fields allowed me to look at life from different perspectives. Thanks to my openness to innovations, I met programming as a hobby. However, for a while, I decided to continue my career in this direction. Learning new technologies is my biggest passion.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on exciting projects! Let's connect.
